# DEVOPS-NODEJS-SELLENIUM
This repo is built as the part of Graphic Era University Devops assignment 
for 3rd year

## Assingment
I have used the `NodeJs` and `selenium-webdriver` 

## Setting up the project
1. Clone the project
2. Move into root dir
3. Run command `npm install` (make sure you have node installed else download it from https://nodejs.org/en/)
4. For running the login script run command `npm run login`
5. For running the register script run command `npm run register`

Since the automation may be a little fast and to prove that data is not hardcoded on it, you can check http://localhost:5000 
and can click buttons after running the command `npm start`
